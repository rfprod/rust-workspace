## Requirements

In order to run own copy of the project one must fulfill the following requirements.

### Supported operating systems

- :trophy: [Debian based Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based) - `recommended`
  - install all global dependencies
    ```bash
    bash tools/shell/install.sh all
    ```
  - see help for available options
    ```bash
    bash tools/shell/install.sh ?
    ```
- :trophy: [OSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) - `recommended`
  - install all global dependencies
    ```bash
    bash tools/shell/install.sh all osx
    ```
  - see help for available options
    ```bash
    bash tools/shell/install.sh ?
    ```
- :no_entry_sign: [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) - `not recommended`
  - install shellcheck
    ```powershell
    iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
    scoop install shellcheck
    ```
  - recommended shell: [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) > `Git BASH`
  - one will have to figure out oneself how to install the `commitizen` package, the instructions for Linux will possibly work (see below)

### Integrated development environment

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - recommended for all operating systems

### Core dependencies

- [Bash 5](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/) - `right now is required for OSX to use the global commitizen installation`
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) - `right now is required for Linux to use the global commitizen installation`
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

## Committing changes to the repo

### Linux

Using [commitizen cli](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) is mandatory.

The commit message are validated during the premerge checks.

It is assumed that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.

Given the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) is installed, and [commitizen cli is installed as a global dependency](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#conventional-commit-messages-as-a-global-utility), the following command should be used to initiate the commit process

```bash
git cz
```

Alternatively, given there are no conflicts with other projects that use [the commitizen npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen), one could install commitizen globally via `pypi` like this

```bash
sudo pip3 install -U Commitizen
```

### OSX

Using [commitizen](https://pypi.org/project/commitizen/) is mandatory.

The commit message are validated during the premerge checks.

After installing the package as a global utility using the following command

```bash
brew install commitizen
```

one can use one of the following commands to initiate the commit process

```bash
cz commit
```

or

```bash
cz c
```

## General Tooling

This project was generated using [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

<p align="center"><img src="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/images/Cargo-Logo-Small.png" width="450"></p>

ðŸ”Ž **Cargo is the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) [package manager](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/glossary.html#package-manager). Cargo downloads your Rust [package's](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/glossary.html#package) dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to [crates.io](https://crates.io/), the Rust community [package registry](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/appendix/glossary.html#package-registry).**
